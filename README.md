# FinanceDashboard
Financial dashboard application aimed at data visualization for user transaction data.

## Status
This project is a work-in-progress. [The author](https://github.com/jhorn00) works full-time as a SWE and lacks the time to work this project daily, weekly, or even monthly. Progress will continue, one way or another.

## Future Plans
The following are planned features or improvements:
- Users
    - This is a pretty crucial feature that has yet to be implemented. The database and queries have been prepared for such an addition, it just needs to be written up for the client and server.
- Stability
    - A good deal of error checking is needed throughout the project
- SSL/TLS for Hosted Release
    - Certificates are in the works, but a few things take priority. Namely, long-term hosting solution and ironing-out the existing application.
- Kubernetes Manifests
    - Some work has already been done to set up the manifests for Kubernetes, but priority for this falls below basic functionality and security.

## Note
Subdirectories contain their own READMEs for instructions, troubleshooting, etc.
